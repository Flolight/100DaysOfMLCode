# 100DaysOfMLCode

A repository to try to share regularly my progress on machine learning topics.

If you want to find the datasets associated with the code examples, feel free to download them here: [superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning)

## Day 1

* Find material
* Why ML matters
* Install Python, Anaconda, understand how they work

I started by importing libraries, importing datasets, begin to understand data preprocessing (missing data replaced by the mean, median or most frequent value, depending on the usecase)
Learned the different types of machine learning algorithms (supervised or not).

## Day 2

* Experimenting about categorical data with sklearn.preprocessing

First code file can be found [here](./courses/MachineLearningAZ_Python_HandsOn/data_preprocessing.py)
