# 100DaysOfMLCode

A repository to try to share regularly my progress on machine learning topics.

If you want to find the datasets associated with the code examples, feel free to download them here: [superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/machine-learning)

## Day 1

* Find material
* Why ML matters
* Install Python, Anaconda, understand how they work

I started by importing libraries, importing datasets, begin to understand data preprocessing (missing data replaced by the mean, median or most frequent value, depending on the usecase)
Learned the different types of machine learning algorithms (supervised or not).

## Day 2

* Experimenting about categorical data with sklearn.preprocessing
* Why and how Split between test and training set
* Feature scaling

First code file can be found [here](./courses/MachineLearningAZ_Python_HandsOn/preprocessing/data_preprocessing.py) and a preprocessing template [here](./courses/MachineLearningAZ_Python_HandsOn/preprocessing/data_preprocessing_template.py).

## Day 3

* Simple Linear Regression algorithm overview
* Method of ordinary least squares

An example on how to use the simple linear regression to predict salaries depending on the number of years of experience [here](./courses/MachineLearningAZ_Python_HandsOn/regression/simple_linear_regression.py)
